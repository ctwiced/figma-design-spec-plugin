## ‚ú® Features

-   **Automatic Spec Generation:** Creates spec sheets with a single click.
-   **Cloned & Focused Visuals:** Each spec sheet includes a faded clone of the original frame, highlighting only the relevant elements for clear communication.
-   **Numbered Annotations:** Automatically generates numbered dots and lines to connect specs to elements, with a corresponding legend.
-   **Intelligent Collision Avoidance:** Annotation lines are automatically offset to prevent overlap, ensuring legibility even with closely-packed elements.

### Supported Specifications

-   **Spacing:** Detects and annotates `padding` and `itemSpacing` (gap) in Auto Layout frames.
-   **Colors:** Finds all solid colors (both raw hex values and bound variables), groups them, and lists every element using that color.
-   **Radius:** Detects and annotates corner radius values, whether they are uniform or individual corners.
-   **Typography:** Groups all text layers by style or by variable and lists all instances.
